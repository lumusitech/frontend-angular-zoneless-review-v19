# Angular19

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Created with `ng new angular19`, with SCSS, Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG/Prerendering), Server Routing and App Engine APIs (Developer Preview)

## Initial changes

- **angular.json:** Add changeDetection on push into schematics file. With this, every time we create a component with cli (ng g c ...) angular adds changeDetectionStrategy onPush on component. Besides, we add skipTests because, in the end, we add custom tests with Jest and Testing Library.

  ```js
  "schematics": {
        "@schematics/angular:component": {
          "style": "scss",
          "changeDetection": "OnPush",
          "skipTests": true
        }
      },
  ```

- **app.config.ts:** Change Zonejs change detection by Zoneless (signals).

  ```js
  providers: [
    // provideZoneChangeDetection({ eventCoalescing: true }),
    provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(),
    ...
  ]
  ```

- **app.config.ts:** Add the withComponentInputBinding method to provideRouter to get route parameters using only traditional @Input or Input (signal).

  ```js
  providers: [
    ...
    provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding()),
    ...
  ]
  ```

- **app.config.ts:** Add the httpClient method to do http requests and change the default rxjs for fetch

  ```js
  providers: [
    ...
    provideHttpClient(withFetch()),
    ...
  ]
  ```

  - **app.config.ts:** The withEventReplay method allows us to cache interactions when hydration is not yet finished, in other words, when JavaScript is not yet ready to use.

  ```js
  providers: [
    ...
    provideClientHydration(withEventReplay()),
    ...
  ]
  ```

- **app.config.ts:** Add the withIncrementalHydration method to do defer hydration, in other words, it allows us to load JavaScript when one or another condition that we have established is met.

  ```js
  providers: [
    ...
    provideClientHydration(withEventReplay(), withIncrementalHydration()),
    ...
  ]
  ```

- **app.config.ts:** Completed modification:

  ```js
  export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
    providers: [provideExperimentalZonelessChangeDetection(), provideRouter(routes, withComponentInputBinding()), provideHttpClient(withFetch()), provideClientHydration(withEventReplay(), withIncrementalHydration())],
  };
  ```

  Then, In any html component, we can use:

  ```html
  <!-- For example -->
  @defer(hydration on viewport) {
  <app-any-component />
  }

  <!-- OR  -->
  @defer(hydration on hover) {
  <app-any-component />
  }

  <!-- OR -->
  @defer(on iddle; hydration on interaction) {
  <app-any-component />
  }
  ```

- **tsconfig.json:** Add an alias for the app path"

  ```js
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
    "baseUrl": "./",
    "paths": {
      "@app/*": [
        "src/app/*"
      ]
    }
  },
  ```

## Container/presentational pattern

### separation of concerns - SoC

One way to enforce separation of concerns is by using the Container/Presentational pattern

- **Presentational Components**: Components that care about how data is shown to the user.

- **Container Components:** Components that care about what data is displayed to the user. In addition, it is responsible for communicating with external entities.

## Single source of truth architecture

In this project, we centralize app data into state using signals. The character module integrates an example with this architecture.
